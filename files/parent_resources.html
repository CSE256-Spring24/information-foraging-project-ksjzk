    <h1>Frequently asked Questions</h1>
    <h2><b>How will the nursery school ensure a smooth transition for my child to the school?</b></h2>
    <h3>You should come to the orientation!</h4>
    <h3>This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
      opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
      hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
      overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.
      The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
      orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
      Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
      before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday

    <h2><b>How does the nursery school approach discipline?</b></h2>
    <h3>
      The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
      for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
      to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
      rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
      safe.	
      The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
      appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
      stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
      the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
      their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
      more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
      lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.
      For a more detailed description, please check our parent handbook for additional informations.

    <h2><b>How does the nursery school foster communication between staff and parents?</b></h2>
    <h3>
      Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
      give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
      emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
      concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
      or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.		
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h2><b>How does the nursery school assess the knowledge and progress of my child?</b></h2>
    <h3>
      Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
      conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
      keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
      development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
      writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
      in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	
      The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
      informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
      more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
      time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.
