          Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with
          children in their play, conversations and observations both in the
          classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child,
          writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their
          development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of
          the childrenâ€™s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to
          discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance
          needed skills for children. The school has two Parent Conferences
          during the school year. The fall conference is an informal,
          getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference
          includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher
          conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and
          by request of parents and/or teachers.
